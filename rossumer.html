                    <p>It's summer time! Today to me is my first official day of summer. I started interning, and finally back on the work grind after a little sleepy-time off last week when my term ended. But I got frustrated after I slept as much as I could. I couldn't just stay and sit still. So I've decided to add.......(drumroll.....)<br><br>

                        <strong>THE ROSS SUMMER CHALLENGE!!!!</strong>
                        <br><br><br>

                        In one of the Christmas/New Year episodes of Friends, specifically Season 5, Episode 11, or AKA <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0583511/" target= "_blank">"The One with All the Resolutions"</a>, of Friends, Ross's New Year's Resolution is to do one thing every day that he hasn't ever done before. 
                        <br>I think I'm a bit behind on a New Year's Resolution but my summer resolution is going to be the same. 

                        <br><br>
                        <strong>Every day for the rest of the summer, I am going to do something I have never done before!</strong> <br>
                        I will be documenting everything that I do here, it's just a little challenge, but I'm excited to see what I can and will do.

                        <strong>Never been formal suit shopping for a man</strong>

                    <p>Today is technically day 1 of my challenge, and I do have a couple things that I have never done. But before today, I have never actually legitmately taken my brother suit shopping. My baby bro is such a champ in my life, and he's off to Speech and Debate nationals in a couple of weeks. Ever since I left for college, his speech and debate/professional speaking career has really taken off and I'm not there to help him with the finesse details of his attire, so it falls on my dad. But since I'm back, I decided to go with him. 

                        I learned all the tricks of the suit trade that he's picked up from dad, but since my brother is in that awkward stage of supernatural growth, it's hard to find a suit that comes in the right proportions for his body or won't be grown out of in a couple weeks. (Oh freshman year of high school... the surge of everyone's heights). I'm going to add pictures soon, but it was a great experience, and I know I got to annoy my brother with making him try on unnecessary clothes just for the heck of it, but hey, big sister duties, am I right?
