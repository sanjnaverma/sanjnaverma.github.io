                    <p>It's summer time! Today to me is my first official day of summer. I started interning, and finally back on the work grind after a little sleepy-time off last week when my term ended. But I got frustrated after I slept as much as I could. I couldn't just stay and sit still. So I've decided to add.......(drumroll.....)<br><br>

                        <strong>THE ROSS SUMMER CHALLENGE!!!!</strong>

                        In one of the Christmas/New Year episodes of Friends, specifically Season 5, Episode 11, or AKA <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0583511/" target= "_blank">"The One with All the Resolutions"</a>, Ross's New Year's Resolution is to do one thing every day that he hasn't ever done before. 
                        <br>I think I'm a bit behind on a New Year's Resolution but my summer resolution is going to be the same. 

                        <br><br>
                        <strong>Every day for the rest of the summer, I am going to do something I have never done before!</strong> <br>
                        I will be documenting everything that I do here, it's just a little challenge, but I'm excited to see what I can and will do.

                    <p>Today is technically day 1 of my challenge, and I do have a couple things that I have never done. But before today, I have never actually legitmately taken my brother suit shopping. My baby bro is such a champ in my life, and he's off to Speech and Debate nationals in a couple of weeks. Ever since I left for college, his speech and debate/professional speaking career has really taken off and I'm not there to help him with the finesse details of his attire, so it falls on my dad. But since I'm back, I decided to go with him. 

                        I learned all the tricks of the suit trade that he's picked up from dad, but since my brother is in that awkward stage of supernatural growth, it's hard to find a suit that comes in the right proportions for his body or won't be grown out of in a couple weeks. (Oh freshman year of high school... the surge of everyone's heights). I'm going to add pictures soon, but it was a great experience, and I know I got to annoy my brother with making him try on unnecessary clothes just for the heck of it, but hey, big sister duties, am I right?

                    <p>In New York, it's so easy to travel around, thanks to the subway system. Sometimes I do get scared coming back to the Bay because I'm not sure how it will be to get around with so many other people in the house. But today for the first time, I got to ride the VTA!

                        Let me tell you that it's actually hard to figure out which train is going where for the first time. But I got a great view of Great America, Levi's Stadium, and the heart of the Silicon Valley on my inaugural journey.

Truth be told though, I have never actually gone more than two days of following a workout regimen. However, today is day 3 of that workout regimen and I just got back from the gym having done the workout, and more! I feel great, going to get some good protein in my diet and then sit back for the rest of the night. It's good to do this!

But, today, for the first time, I <strong>watched a basketball game on my own!</strong>. I don't know how it happened, but I wanted to turn to ESPN when I got home, and I wanted to watch the game.

Day 5, I taught myself how to play Apologize, by Timbaland, on the piano by ear thanks to my cousin's guidance! (Owe you big time, cuzzo). The next challenge is to get my finger dexterity on the piano keyboard back, so I've been practicing my scales, tempo, and cadences. Any musicians, got any advice?

                    <p>I got to watch the Kingsman with my brother today and it was absolutely fabulous. If you think about, all spy movies have been the crux of what wearable technologies can do for a person. I used to be really obsessed with spies, and spy-characters, and after watching the Kingsman, the old/slightly rusted spy wheels of my childhood started spinning again. I wonder what technology could be doing for world class/top secret spies. You could be having camoflauge suits already, a hybrid plane that's super quiet when it lands, you could have paper that changes its ink to match the currency of the country you're in (ooh... if that last one isn't created, we should totally try building it!)
